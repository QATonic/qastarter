Feature: User API
  As an API consumer
  I want to manage users via REST API
  So that I can perform CRUD operations

  @smoke
  Scenario: Get all users returns 200
    When I send a GET request to "/users"
    Then the response status code should be 200
    And the response should contain a list of users

  @smoke
  Scenario: Create a new user returns 201
    Given I have a new user with name "John Doe" and email "john@example.com"
    When I send a POST request to "/users"
    Then the response status code should be 201
